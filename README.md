# Using Pipes for Component Input

This *Hallpass Sandbox* project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.6.

## Overview

Over the years of working with Angular, I have confined my use of pipes to formatting values for output in a page.  Today, we explore 
using pipes to alter data for component input.



## Tailwind CSS

We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) in our projects.  While not necessary for a *sandbox* project, we can't help but to add a bit of style. Even if you are not familiar with Tailwind, you should be able to understand the intent of most of the styling (via classes).  For those familiar with Tailwind, we are using v4. You can learn more about Tailwind by reading [the docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) and [how to install/configure in Angular](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/angular).
